## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
Recommendation engines are becoming more and more popular across different platforms and business models. Not only Netflix uses recommendation systems to provide the most appropriate movies and TV shows to users, but also online publishing platforms such as Medium allowing its users to find articles most intersting to them.

There are different approaches to recommendation system and three of them have been implemented in this project.

I. Rank Based Recommendations
II. User-User Based Collaborative Filtering
III. Matrix Factorization
